# A terminal resume...

Ok, so that makes it sound worse than it is. About a year or so ago I decided to use what I had learned in jQuery to put together a page that looks and works pretty much like a terminal on Mac, and to be honest I'm rather happy with the results.

The code does need a lot of tidying up though as it's not the best example of my jQuery skills but please fell free to fork away and have a little fun with it. You can find it running at http://adamonishi.com/resume

## Update

Since it's initial conception I've completely re-written all the JavaScript to work without jQuery. I've added a few extra features like the ability to download a full PDF and I'm currently working on getting command history working properly.
