			<h1>Adam Onishi - Resume</h1>

			<section id="about" class="section">

				<h2>About me</h2>

				<p>I am a self motivated and expert front-end &amp; PHP developer, working with the latest and most exciting web technologies. I enjoy an active role contributing to the web community via writing and created the extremely successful web events and community sites <a href="http://12devs.co.uk">12 Devs</a> and <a href="http://12devsofxmas.co.uk">12 Devs of Xmas</a>.</p>

				<p>I’m a regular public speaker having spoken at a variety of events and conferences, from monthly meet ups, Front End London and London Web Standards, through to international conferences including the New York Sass Conf and Devs Love Bacon in London. During 2013 I wrote a book with Apress - Pro WordPress Theme Development <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Adam-Onishi/e/B00J35BQZG/">Expert's Voice in Web Development</a>.</p>

				<p>I started road cycling during 2013 and after only a few months was able to start raising money for charity, most notably in 2014 where I participated in the Prudential RideLondon raising £700 for the Save the Rhino charity.</p>

				<p><strong>My ultimate career goal is to always be doing things that interest me and aiming to make a difference to the web</strong>.</p>
